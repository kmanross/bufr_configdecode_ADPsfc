This directory will receive the executable files prepared by the
install/install.sh script.

The preprocess.csh script, already present in this directory, is a simple
tool for C-shell users to pre-process RDA ds461.0 files.  It performs the
gunzip'ing, untar'ing, and little_endian conversion (on linux platforms) 
necessary to prepare data files to the form which the decoders can ingest.

To run preprocess.csh, place downloaded web server ds461.0 BUFR data files
in "bufrobs", and edit and run the preprocess.csh script accordingly.
Unpacked files will be placed in the "bufrobs" directory.  If
desired, these can be moved to a directory of your choosing.

Additional preprocessing, if necessary, may then be done.  See the
"grabbufr" README.
